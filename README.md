## Introduction 
In our rapidly evolving digital environment, businesses such as government, insurance, retail, healthcare, and finance place a high premium on maintaining strong cybersecurity. With security data dispersed among logs, tickets, and network events, organizations frequently struggle to stay compliant and identify new risks. The development of an AI-powered agent intended to gather and examine these many data sources solves that problem. Decision-makers are given a clear picture of the cybersecurity environment by the agent's transformation of raw data into dynamic visuals and user-friendly, real-time dashboards. The danger of financial loss, harm to one's reputation, and legal problems is reduced with this integrated strategy, which also enhances threat identification and simplifies compliance monitoring.

## Problem Statment
Various stakeholder require specific insights, but it  becomes challenging to interpret security data and its standards. Data from multiple sources (Anomaly Logs, Network Anomaly Logs, Task Datasets, and Stored Alerts) creates problems with data visualization because data exists in different formats and structures. Without real time data Organizations lack security breaches, compliance violations and operational inefficiencies. To address this, A dynamic dashboard system combine real-time data sources and represent in easy-to-understand format to meet technical and non-technical user requirements,  so organizational security teams can effectively deal with threats and regulatory standards while responding promptly to security incidents.
