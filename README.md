## Problem Statment
Various stakeholder require specific insights, but it  becomes challenging to interpret security data and its standards. Data from multiple sources (Anomaly Logs, Network Anomaly Logs, Task Datasets, and Stored Alerts) creates problems with data visualization because data exists in different formats and structures. Without real time data Organizations lack security breaches, compliance violations and operational inefficiencies. To address this, A dynamic dashboard system combine real-time data sources and represent in easy-to-understand format to meet technical and non-technical user requirements,  so organizational security teams can effectively deal with threats and regulatory standards while responding promptly to security incidents.
